-In this project first the data of subscribers which consist of name, subscribedChannel, subscribedDate is initialised in database and then when we click on /subscribers button in home page then we make a get call at /subscribers endpoint that response with an array of subscribers (an Object ) .

-when we click on /subscribers/names button in home page then we make a get call at /subscribers/names endpoint that response with an array of subscribers (an Object with only two fields name and subscribedChannel ) .

-when we enter valid id in input field of home page and click on /subscribers/:id button in home page then we make a get call at /subscribers/:id endpoint that response with a subscriber (an Object) with gived id .

-when we enter Invalid id in input field of home page and click on /subscribers/:id button in home page then we make a get call at /subscribers/:id endpoint that response status codfe 400 and Error message ({message: error.message}) .
